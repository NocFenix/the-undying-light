  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  “Some people, they say that they fear what lies in the darkness, hiding in the deep shadows waiting for them. News of incidents across the Frontier and Outer Rim talk of monsters and aliens; corporate sabotage and cover-ups; of UA on UPP hostilies.
  <br />
  <br />
  "Talk out there makes space seem dark, dead, and empty; a place where a light in the darkness gives hope and courage.
  <br />
  <br />
  "Obviously, none of those fuckers have ever visited NN3325, Devil’s Peak. Claimed by the UA under Seegson control, Devil’s Peak is a planet that never gets to see the darkness that everyone else seems to fear so much. Trapped in a ternary star system, with stars of white, blue and yellow, all of the surface areas of Devil’s Peak are bombarded by constant light.
  <br />
  <br />
  "So why in the fuck did we settle here? Money, and isn’t that always the case out here? Re-routed from Alpha Linna after it was claimed by the ICSC, us poor “shake and bake” colonists were dropped on this resource rich rock with prospects of unrivaled resources, which should yield unrivaled cash flow.
  <br />
  <br />
  "That was 33 years ago. The colony definitely got situated and up and running beautifully. Mining operations were quickly established, pulling raw gold, hydrogen, and uranium from the belly of this beast. The colony  is nestled neatly in the only valley on this desert world: in the blown out caldera of some extinct volcano, which our founder Oswald Gram, dubbed Devil’s Peak, since he felt that we’d been sent to hell itself.
  <br />
  <br />
  "In the last 33 years we’ve seen plenty of people come and go; mostly go. Now down to a skeleton crew of people who maintain the facilities and watch over the Joes that labor day and, well, day, we keep this place from falling apart and making money for the Company. And hopefully, we don’t just lose our fucking minds like so many others who couldn’t stand the constant light.”
